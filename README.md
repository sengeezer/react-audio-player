# Iwoca music player

## Credits

This player draws inspiration from [Wes Bos' 30 day Javascript challenge](https://javascript30.com/) but uses React instead of plain Javascript.

Thanks to [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) for pointers and to [Noise Addicts](http://www.noiseaddicts.com/) for [the samples](http://www.noiseaddicts.com/free-samples-mp3/).

# Original notes (abbreviated)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

* Use `npm start` to run the app in the development mode, featuring hot reload, at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
* `npm test` launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. [not implemented]
* `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

* `npm run eject` : If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
